In order to run the program, it is required to run server.py,client1.py,client2.py,client3.py and client4.py concurrently. This can be done in pycharm by making seperate python configurations for each program and then adding them all to a compound. The clients and server are set up to use the local ip, so it should not require changing.

Details for modules and other software required can be found in my documentation.
